Personal project to manage mp3

takes 100 "random" (depends on filesystem order) music files from given folder (recursively)

these files will be moved to folder, named "quantum"

I can manually modify files in quantum (listen to them, delete the ones I don't like, correct tags etc)

After I am satisfied with condition of the files, I can move them to Outbox folder (manually at this time), and repeat whole procedure with new quantum
